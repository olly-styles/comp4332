## create_SQLite 
Adds all the data to a database and creates an idex. There is also an example query at the bottom. 

*Note:* This will take a long time to run. The database created is ~4.3GB

## feature_extraction
This is the interesting file where the predictions are made, using the database created.
It takes a few minutes to run on my laptop (4GB RAM, i3)
